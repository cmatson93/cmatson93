## 🤖 My Work: 
I spend most of my days building out tools to help drive the adoption of robotics and automation at SoftBank Robotics. When I'm not doing that I'm most likely looking for the next cool thing to learn and something fun to build. 

## 👩‍💻 Things I'm currently learning: 
Diving into all things Webpack 5 Module Federation and MicroFrontends. I've wrote about it some on my blog you can read HERE. 

## 👫🐶 When not coding: 
When I'm not coding you can most likely find me hanging out with my husband and dog. We like playing tennis, eating good food and a good tv show binge or watching a movie from the comfort of our home.
