## 👩‍💻 My Work: 
### My passions lie on the frontend of the stack. I love building out user friendly scalable UI. Previously at SoftBank Robotics 🤖 . Currently at Taco Bell 🔔 working on the e-commerce platform. Your welcome for all the tacos in advance 🌮 ! 

## 🤓 Things I'm currently learning: 
### Deep diving into Unit testing at work. Also starting to use Typescript for the first time. Interested in learning a mobile framework next. 

## 👫🐶 When not coding: 
### When I'm not coding you can most likely find me hanging out with my husband and dog. We like playing tennis, eating good food and a good tv show binge or watching a movie from the comfort of our home.
