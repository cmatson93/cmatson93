## 👩‍💻 My Work:

### I'm a software engineer with my passion focused on the frontend of the stack. I love building out user friendly scalable UI. Previously at SoftBank Robotics 🤖 and Taco Bell 🔔 currently at Niantic working on their social platform across their many AR map based games.

## 🤓 Things I'm currently learning:

### Dabbling in Web 3 like the rest of the internet. Interested in building something with Remix and always looking more into mobile development.

## 👫🐶 When not coding:

### When I'm not coding you can most likely find me hanging out with my husband and dog. We like playing tennis, eating good food and a good tv show binge or watching a movie from the comfort of our home.
